/*

For this quiz, can you use this script, which is in the <head> of index.html,
to change the boring placeholder image to a picture of a cute puppy?

Remember, you'll need to pass a function into the jQuery object to run 
when the document is ready.

Here's a URL for a picture of a puppy: http://placepuppy.it/350/150

Good luck!

$(document).ready(function() {
	$('img').attr("src","http://227rsi2stdr53e3wto2skssd7xe.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/medicine-bag-730x280.png")

});
